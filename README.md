This is a script that takes a video or photo file and posts it to a Telegram chat or/and to a blog. The Media file is posted along with comments to it. The comments should be provided in the metadata in the media file itself or in a [sidecar file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidecar_file)

The script can be used to support the scenario, when a user keeps all their media files and comments to them locally, and posts some of them to the Internet. 

The sript is being developed, it is not ready to be used yet.
